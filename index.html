Yet somehow he returned back to help his national team. And even though Argentina left early in the 2018 world cup and lost the semi-finals to Brazil in the 2019 Copa America, he kept going with his head foward. Eventually, after years of torment he won his first Copa America in 2021. It boosted the morale of not only our team but the entire nation of Argnetina. Then with his incredible team and determination he won the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.   </p>
